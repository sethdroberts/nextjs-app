# knock_every_door
Interactive webpage for the Knock Every Door initiative

Components of Map:
1. On click, display all info about it. And link to update the section. And maybe link to download map for that section (printable). Make sure to give Streams of Light full credit, etc.
2. Ability to filter by year and type of activity (research how to do this)
3. Few options to verify. When update, will just continually be the most recent one.
    1. Tammie manually reviews - probably best
        1. For submission, required to put in a church, so we can call to verify if unfamiliar.
    2. Simple password
    3. MISDA email
4. Sidebar with population/homes reached as part of the total.
5. On hover, shows who did it and when they did it.
6. Ability to color code them either by all one color or no color; maybe need a binary attribute (if completed or not) and a separate source attribute, so we can color them based on those.
7. Have regular maps hidden, but show boundaries when hover 

Website Components:
Website - like type form. 
Bold headline
Sub header with current count of doors, maybe specifics about what weâ€™re seeking to accomplish
Then a video promo with b roll and micheff, Craig, SSPM, and students, pastors, reach, etc.


Then how to get involved - 4 options with links

Then a map of our current progress, would be good to have a menu bar item to access it directly, maybe a one page with menu bar items that move to div.
Links to news reports of our progress and link to sign up.
Link to donate specifically to REACH literature.

At bottom - project of misda.

Map Page:
1. Password protected; simple password; if haven't accessed before, simple form to request access; automatically emails password + instructions to email given.
2. Use Xata and Python program to get all church names and links. Use simple query by ID and a drop-down form to get a page with a simple link to the Google Drive folder with the maps.
